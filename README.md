This repository is to be used to track my progress for the Metagenomic Population Genetic Statistics project at the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS).

<b>Currently working on:</b>
- Comparing clustering methods by # of clusters, intra-cluster divergence, and inter-cluster divergence
- Allele frequency distribution value

<b>Completed:</b>
- Inferring VCFs to reference genome; build a full genome for each sample
- Generating phylogenetic trees from sample genomes
- Building pairwise divergence calculators for strain genomes
- Performing hierarchical Ward's linkage and average linkage clustering on SKANI and mummer data with different threshold values

<b>Primary languages:</b>
- Python
- R

<b>Packages of interest:</b>
- bcftools (http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/)
- SplitsTree 6 (https://github.com/husonlab/splitstree6/blob/main/doc/user-manual.md)
- PopGenome (https://rdrr.io/cran/PopGenome/)
